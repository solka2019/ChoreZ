## Overviewnpm

This is an application to support parents to motivate kids to work on their chores. There will be two types of users:a parent or caregiver and a child. Both of them will need to login to have access to the website. The parent/caregiver will choose a list of chores for the child who will login and see what are the tasks/chores that she/he needs to accomplish for the day/week... 
After completing the designated chore, the child will mark it as complete and earn points for it. There will be different number of points depending on what the parent/caregiver had chosen when setting up the list of chores. After having all of the items on the list as "completed," the child would be rewarded. Rewards decisions are for the parents to decide.
